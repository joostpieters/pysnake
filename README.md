A simple implementation of the snake game in python.

 * Direct your snake using hjkl, wasd, or arrow keys to eat the treats which
   appear on the screen.
 * You can pause at any time by pressing space; press space again to unpause.
 * The game ends when you press q or collide with your own tail or an edge.
