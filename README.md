Instructions
------------

 * Direct your snake using **hjkl**, **wasd**, or **arrow keys**.
 * Start by spotting and collecting treat 0, then each higher-numbered treat in
   sequence. When you've collected the highest-numbered treat, look for the new
   treat 0.
 * Every time you collect a complete set of treats, a rock appears to impede
   your path.
 * Occasionally, a gem appears, which you can collect like a treat.
 * You can pause at any time by pressing **space**; press space again to
   unpause.
 * The game ends when you press **q**, eat a treat out of order, or collide
   with something (your own tail, a rock, or an edge).
