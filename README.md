Instructions

 * Collect all the treats in the sequence, in order, as many times as you can.
   The default sequence is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
 * Every treat you collect is added to your tail.
 * Every time you collect a complete set of treats, a rock appears and impedes
   your path.
 * The game ends when you eat a treat out of order or collide with a rock,
   your tail, or an edge (if edge wrapping is turned off).

Bonus Items
-----------
Special items for you to collect might appear, depending on configuration.
They don't make your tail longer, they're just for bragging rights.

 * Gems may occasionally appear at random.
 * When there are enough rocks on the board, they may all turn into gems.
 * When there are enough gems on the board, they may all turn into a single
   trophy.


Configuration
-------------
You can change a lot of settings by altering the all-caps variables in the
beginning of the script.
