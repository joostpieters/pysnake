Controls

   again to unpause.
 * You can end the game at any time by pressing **q**.


Instructions
------------

 * Start by spotting and collecting treat 0, then each higher-numbered treat in
   sequence. Every time you collect a treat, it is added to your tail.
 * When you've collected the highest-numbered treat, continue with the new
   treat 0.
 * Every time you collect a complete set of treats, a rock appears and impedes
   your path.
 * Depending on configuration, gems may randomly appear. You can collect them
   like treats, but they don't make your tail longer.
 * Depending on configuration, rocks might turn into gems once a certain
   number of them have appeared.
 * The game ends when you eat a treat out of order or collide with a rock,
   your tail, or an edge (if edge wrapping is turned off).


Configuration
-------------
You can change a lot of settings by altering the all-caps variables in the
beginning of the script.
